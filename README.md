wp-side-comments
================

Based on Eric Anderson's [SideComments.js](https://github.com/aroc/side-comments) to enable inline commenting. Medium.com-style inline commenting for WordPress

Please note that this project is very much in beta. Alpha, even. It's being actively developed and there will be several items going upstream to the main javascript library, too.

I'd absolutely love to have some feedback in terms of bug reports or pull-requests!
